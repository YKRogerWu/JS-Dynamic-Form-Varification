## Project-01: Form Varification by Javascript
folder: [YKRogerWu/JS-Dynamic-Form-Varification](https://github.com/YKRogerWu/JS-Dynamic-Form-Varification)

**Description** <br>
This project runs a common sign-up page where a form is used to retrieve and varify user's input. Instead of using built-in HTML form validation ("type" attribute of the input tag), Javascript enables the input rules more flexible and manageable. For example, we can use regular expression to ensure the specific to be in compliance with database, or to remind the user what kind of mistake they have made which resulted in a fail submission. It also promotes the cooperation between HTML and CSS when the appearance need to alter under some circumstances, such as pop-out message or specification of mistaken input fields. <br/>
In this minor project, Javascript varification was used to further improve the communication between users and the webpage. That is, it tells the user whether their input field is valid or not as soon as the cursor leaves the field, before clicking the submit buttom. The reason for the invalid input can be even specified if they meet predicted behaviours.
